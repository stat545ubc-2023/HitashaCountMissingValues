Description: The package created for this assignment provides a function called
  `count_all_missing_by_group()`. This allows you to count missing values
  for all columns by group. It creates a new data frame with one row per
  level of group. The first column of the output data frame contains the
  levels of group while the rest of the columns contain the number of
  missing values for all columns in the data except those in group.
